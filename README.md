## ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Statement

## üòÉ Inspiration & Motivation
Our inspiration to champion women's empowerment stems from their remarkable ability to perform and achieve, underscoring their equal importance to men. As students, boys, and family members, we are motivated to contribute towards the cause of empowering women, offering them encouragement to persevere and never surrender.
For this, we developed a mobile application named **‚ÄúShieldHer‚Äù**
